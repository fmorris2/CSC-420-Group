# CSC 420 (Graphical User Interfaces) w/ Prof. Alex Pantaleev - Group Project

The project consists of designing and implementing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to a program
back-end.
1. Back-end
The back-end does not have to be implemented by the student. Students are free to choose a back-end
against which to design and implement their GUI. It does not even have to be an existing program, as
long as students understand its functionality (e.g., students may pick “a generic/stereotypical MUA”
against which to program their GUI, as opposed to picking “the mail command-line program”).
– If the back-end already exists (as a library or a command-line application), students should read its
documentation before starting work on the interface, and prepare a document pinpointing the exact
back-end functionality their interface will present to users.
– Otherwise, students should devise a similar document targeting a stereotypical back-end of their
choice.
In both cases, students should have a clear understanding of the goals of the back-end program, and the
tasks their GUI will present to the users.
Example back-end programs are:
– File manager (stereotypical)
– ls, mv, cp, find, grep, etc. (existing)
– Mail user agent (MUA) (stereotypical)
– mail (existing)
– Music player (stereotypical)
– mpd client (mpc) (existing)
– Video player (stereotypical)
– mplayer (existing)
– Video manipulator/encoder (stereotypical)
– mencoder (existing)
– Calendar/Organizer (stereotypical)
– calendar (existing)
– CD/DVD burning program (stereotypical)
– wodim (existing)
– Image manipulation program (stereotypical)
– imagemagick (existing)
2. Target user group
After picking a back-end program, students should carefully describe the target users of the program, as
well as any prerequisite knowledge the users should have in order to use the GUI (and the back-end).
